### Formatting 

`---`: starting a new slide.

`name: name-of-the-slide`: must be placed immediately underneath the slide separator "`---`".

`[link text](slide-name)`: referencing a specific slide in the deck.

 `#, ##, ###`: representing level 1, 2, and 3 headers respectively. 
 
 `&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;`: HTML version of header levels (equivalent to `#, ##, ###`).
 
 

### Coloring 

Coloring text through HTML tag or CSS style.

|  colored text     |     HTML tag       |      CSS style        |
|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:---------------------:|
